career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
      I was 6 years old when I first met a computer. It was a monochromic cassettes-based desktop my father brought to replace his typewriter. It was the early 90th, and most of my friend's families brought cars for the same price. This has defined my life.
      By the age of 25, I had commercial experience in C/C++, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. I worked with distributed and high-loaded projects.
      At 27 I decided to run my own outsourcing company. It started as a company of 3 people and grew up to 20 engineers with offices in Moscow and Prague in 4 years.
      I had the CTO role, I built the team, applied SDLC processes, communicated with clients to build requirements, and so on.
      After 6 years I started to see some weaknesses and gaps in my management knowledge which stopped me from getting to the next level, so I decided to take a step back and took a Manager of Engineering role in a US-based company to obtain some practical knowledge of corporate-style management. Simultaneously I've started a broad educational process around IT management (which led me to graduation from the "Leading People and Teams" specialization of the University of Michigan). Now I am preparing to enter the University of Illinois for a Master of Science in Management.

    - role: Software Developer, Entrepreneur
      time: 2003 - March 2012
      company: Labbler Inc., Delaware
      details: |
        **Story**: This is the very start of my software developer career. I’ve started
         as a PHP developer and most of my projects were about supporting, fixing
         and improving things after previous developers. This created my most
         powerful skill - diving into client expectations and legacy code without
         any kind of documentation or initial requirements. Projects were very
         different - corporate websites, online shops, management systems, etc.
         This brought me wide business expertise.

         At one point a friend of mine suggested starting our own clothing store. In
         3 months we reached country-wide size as an online shop and decided to
         open an offline selling point. That was a very unusual, but cool
         experience. I obtain knowledge in direct selling and face-to-face client
         communication.

         After two years I left this business and received a contract with Logibox
         company - the very first automated last-mile delivery stations network in
         Russia. I was a single person responsible for building a management
         system on top of KEBA’s Kepol solution, retailers integration, billing
         automation, etc.
